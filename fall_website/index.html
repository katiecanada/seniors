			<h1>Q. This all looks great! Where can I find out even more?</h1> 
			Thanks! So look. We hate spamming you with all class emails. So instead, nifty <a href="https://www.facebook.com/StanfordSeniors2014"> like this nifty facebook page</a> so you can stay informed of the latest on event times, locations, sign ups, you name it.

				<p> Forget spending your time wandering aimlessly through campus before kickoff looking for a party or tailgate. 
				</p>
				<p> Together with the ASSU Exec, IFC, and Stanford Athletics, we're starting the first ever student tailgate zone on Malohney Field. Open to any and all undergraduates. If you lead a student group, dorm/house, or cultural group, you <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hCecbpD6VAEhTc42BY2kf_40fD1u5Ty-m1FQV32hzZo/viewform">can sign up here to reserve a space for your group's tailgate FOR THE ENTIRE SEASON</a>. We'll even provide you with a tent, table, and grill for your group and handle all the set up / strike before and after the game. You worry about nothing. Just bring the food/drink for your group and have a blast. Did we mention the tailgate zone is right next to the student gate to the Stadium and surrounded by other alumni? Cause it is. </p>

				<p>Don't want to throw your own tailgate? That's fine. Come to ours! Every home game of the season we'll be out there a few hours before kick off throwing a tailgate for any member of 2014. And we'll have plenty of free food on hand from Jimmy V's. </p>

				<p>This is a chance to change Stanford. You don't want to miss it. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hCecbpD6VAEhTc42BY2kf_40fD1u5Ty-m1FQV32hzZo/viewform">Sign up for a space for your group here</a></p>

				<p> Yup, you read that title right. We're throwing a party in the Skybox.</p>

				<p> As the kickoff to our year-long Senior Bucket List Series, we've booked the entire Stanford Stadium Skybox for the Class of 2014 to view the Oregon State away game. Watch the game like Arillaga does. If you've never seen the view from up there (or even if you have), you definitely can not miss this event. Food, drinks, big screen tvs, and we'll even be turning on the massive HD stadium boards to show the game. It's a once in a Stanford career style event. </p>

Houses will be pulling out couches, we're bringing food trucks, and enjoy the away game as if it were at home with thousands of Stanford students. Open to all, and it's going to be nuts.

				<p> Blink an eye and miss the crazy fast Wine Tasting class sign up? Well we think it'd be depraved not provide an opportunity to all seniors to learn how to taste wine. It is, of course, a *necessary* life skill. 
				</p>
				<p>That's why for the lucky first 100 to sign up, we're bringing in partnership with the Stanford Alumni Association, world famous wine writer Mark Oldman. Mark is the wine expert for Pottery Barn and wine columnist for the Food Network. He's flying out to Stanford for the night to teach you the ins and outs of wine. You'll learn how to taste, how to tell the difference between varietals, what to look for when drinking wine. Come out and enjoy a classy and unique experience with your friends. </p>

				<p>Space will be limited to 100 seniors, so look out for the sign up email going out on October 8th</p>

We'll have refreshments in the form of coffee, cookies, chips, and whatever other study/junk food you can imagine out for Seniors at key dining halls and residences around campus. 
				</p>
				<p> Come out for an hour, kick back, relax and destress with your friends while munching on goodies....then get back to work because you still need to pass finals to graduate Stanford :)

This is a chance to have lunch with a professor with a small group of students (no more than 8) and get to know your professors in a more informal setting. Did we mention we have some of the biggest badasses on campus lined up? Oh, and though it's called "Brown Bag", we'll be taking care of lunch. </p>

At lunch on swag day, come out to White Plaza to get a free surprise swag item from yours truly. Why? Because why not. We're seniors and we need to stockpile on free Stanford gear before heading out to the real world where we'll have to pay. More info on exact day and location to come.

			<p> Let's face it. Even the most social of butterflies doesn't know everyone in the class on a deep level. While this may never be the case completely, we should still take a step towards meeting the amazing people around us while they are still here. </p>

			<p>That's why all year long we will be posting reflection essays written by members of the Class of 2014. These essays will be about a wide range of topics, from dreams for the future, to current interests, to fears about graudation, or just general musings on their time at Stanford. If you resonate with something you see, we'll give you the contact info so you can connect with the seniors writing them. At the end of the year, we'll publish a book of them all - a snapshot of the class during Senior Year. </p>

			<p>Stay tuned for the first edition coming in the next week. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/StanfordSeniors2014">You can read them on our Facebook page here</a> and email 2014seniorclasspresidents@lists.stanford.edu or any class cabinet member if you want to write one yourself. </p>
